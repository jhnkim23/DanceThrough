# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Running Program

Start the frontend by running "npm start" in terminal
Followed by setting the backend server with "npm run start-backend" in another terminal. "npm run start-backend" is a custom alias that starts the  flask backend and runs npm on another localhost server. For more info look at package.json "scripts".

# Installing Dependencies

Python libraries must be installed in the virtual environment in the backend named "env". Activate the environment in the backend folder and install any dependencies needed in there.

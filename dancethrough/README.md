# DanceThrough

The intended purpose of this project is to aid users in learning a dance of their choice. The program asks the user for a youtube video url or mp4 file submission of a dance. Pose estimation will be run on the inputted video and the program will output in frontend an interactive overlay where users try to match the poses calculated based on every 8 beat counts.

# Running Program

Start the frontend by running "npm start" in terminal
Followed by setting the backend server with "npm run start-backend" in another terminal. "npm run start-backend" is a custom alias that starts the  flask backend and runs npm on another localhost server. For more info look at package.json "scripts".

# Installing Dependencies

Python libraries must be installed in the virtual environment in the backend named "env". Activate the environment in the backend folder and install any dependencies needed in there.
